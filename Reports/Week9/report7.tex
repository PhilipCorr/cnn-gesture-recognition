\section{Update}

\begin{itemize}

\item App nearly ready to role out. Few things to clear up in meeting but nothing major left.

\item Waiting to hear back about recording permission. Should hear back this week.

\item Did some research into sequence to sequence RNN's. Will implement as soon as app is finished.
	
\end{itemize}

\section{Items for discussion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Can skip a scene passing data through a segue?

\item Fire segue from scene A to B when clicking button in segue C?

\item Best way to initiate variable that doesnâ€™t get a value until segue happens?

\item which finger?

\item How to improve smoothness of number tracing? - may answer next 2 questions also

\item Best way to draw two strokes? Two arrays? Will user use 3 strokes ever? assume 2 max?

\item How to time strokes? start at beginning of first stroke and end at end of second?

\end{itemize}

\section{Plan for Next Week}
In order of priority from top to bottom

\begin{itemize}
\item Further permission to record data

\item Get data stored in a reliable way

\item Make a timetable for the year, more detailed one until christmas?

\item Start into further deep learning resources e.g.~\cite{Ng-Coursera-2016, VincentVanhoucke-Udacity-2016, Nvidia-DL-Course-2016}. Tensorflow also.

\item Investigate paramaterisation of bitmaps.

\end{itemize}
