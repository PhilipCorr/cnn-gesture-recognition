%%% First Section  

\section{Update}

\begin{itemize}

\item Finshed app. Just need to run through some of the back end database stuff to ensure data is safe and that there are no loop holes.

\item Nearly have permission. There were a few minor details to fix up. Nothing major though.

\item No update on the NN side of things. Was focusing on app to get data recorded.
	
\end{itemize}

\section{Items for discussion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Review app and talk through possible database issues

Need to add in force and also the finger and thumb into database

protobuffers - google

create 28x28 bit images and use as test set on trained MNIST

also other way? - convert MNIST to strokes...

arc length and first derivative...
 

\end{itemize}

\section{Plan for Next Week}
In order of priority from top to bottom

\begin{itemize}
\item Get data recorded and test it on CNN by normalising to 28 x 28 so that it's the same as MNIST.

\end{itemize}
